0,"['Following a five-match losing streak, Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) finally managed to cross the finish line on Thursday (15 October) in Sharjah against Royal Challengers Bangalore to keep their campaign alive in IPL 2020. It was a game filled with a lot of drama and contrasting fortunes. Both teams made a lot of tactical blunders throughout the 40 overs, so much so that towards the climax, it seemed both were trying their best to lose. But in the end, Punjab had the last laugh by chasing down 172 on the final ball of the match.', 'Here are some of the major talking points coming out from this closely fought fixture.', ""Spinners dictate terms\n\nWe witnessed quite a few spin-duels in this game. On that tired Sharjah pitch, Punjab included two leggies – Ravi Bishnoi and M Ashwin – in their XI, primarily to counter the AB de Villiers threat. Furthermore, against the RCB left-handers, KL Rahul's surprise move of using the part-time off-spin of Glenn Maxwell (4 overs for 28 runs) worked pretty well too. Comparatively, the Bangalore spinners were not that successful though many believed they were not handled properly by Kohli in this particular fixture. "", 'Interestingly, towards the end, defending just two in the final over against the likes of Chris Gayle and Rahul, Chahal almost did the impossible. He took the game till the last ball and narrowly missed out from making Punjab choke yet again in this IPL.   ', ""Can't AB de Villiers handle leg-spin?\n\nWas it really necessary to have a left-right combination in the middle against the Punjab slow bowlers or do RCB really believe that de Villiers, who has been a batting sensation in this IPL, can't handle two uncapped leg-spinners?"", 'There is no other way one can justify the thought-process of delaying the arrival of the best batsman of the tournament to the crease, especially when the team was looking for a push in the scoring rate.', 'AB de Villiers was held back until the 16th over against KXIP. Image: Sportzpics', 'Batting first the Royal Challengers lost their second wicket in the seventh over, but instead of de Villiers coming in at his usual No 4, it was left-handed Washington Sundar who walked out to join Kohli at the crease. Then even when they lost their third wicket in the 11th over, Shivam Dube got a surprise promotion in the batting order. Eventually, when de Villiers did come out to bat there were only 24 balls left in the innings – a much lesser time to have any significant impact in the game.', 'Yes, de Villiers did get out against leg-spinners on a few occasions in this competition but one can expect a batsman of his calibre to rectify his mistakes. Unfortunately, the decision of holding him back did not work in this game but if one sees the bigger picture, it can be a blessing in disguise for RCB as the team management is now unlikely to repeat such a tactical blunder.', ""Gayle's much-anticipated comeback\n\nBatting out of his normal position, the 'Universal Boss' Chris Gayle showcased his class and hunger for runs in this comeback game. Before Thursday, Chris Gayle had opened in 122 out of his 124 IPL innings. However, here he came out on the backdrop of the 78-run (in 48 balls) opening stand between Rahul and Mayank Agarwal. The 41-year-old, playing his first competitive game since January, adapted to his new role pretty well and did not allow RCB bowlers to dictate terms. After getting his eye in, when Gayle went after Sundar and Mohammed Siraj on his way to a 36-ball half-century, he looked at his vintage best."", ""Kohli's weird bowling plan\n\nAs a leader on the field, Virat Kohli has never been a tactical genius. But at least he tends to follow the basic template. However, in this particular game, he was all over the place with his bowling plans."", ""Firstly, Sundar, who in this competition has one the best economy rates in the powerplay, did not bowl a single delivery until the ninth over. Perhaps, because of the presence of two right-handers (Rahul and Agarwal), he was held back, which actually was a very defensive move. Applying the same old-fashioned logic, RCB's number one wicket-taking option Chahal did not complete his quota because Gayle was batting in the middle-overs."", ""RCB's premier leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal didn't complete his quota of overs against KXIP. Image: Sportzpics"", 'Also, it was surprising for many to see left-arm seamer Isuru Udana bowling just a couple of overs for 14 runs whereas relatively inexperienced Siraj ended up getting one over more despite being expensive.', ""Why didn't KXIP go for a NRR boost?\n\nThough Kings XI have secured much-needed two points from this fixture, one must feel that they unnecessarily dragged the game till the last ball. Punjab needed 11 off the last three overs with nine wickets in hand and with two set batsmen at the crease. At that stage, they were expected to finish it with a few overs to spare to get a boost in the Net Run Rate (NRR) in order to create chances of making a backdoor entry in the playoffs. However, quite strangely, there was not enough intent shown by either Rahul or Gayle to go for that one big hit in those final overs and the ploy almost backfired.

Before the start of the season, they had their best win percentage (for teams against whom they have played 10 or more matches) against Kolkata\xa0– 76 percent, with 19 wins from 25 matches. They continued that dominance with a comprehensive 49-run win over them earlier in this edition at Abu Dhabi and would be looking to get a double on them this season again at the same venue.', ""And with the way they are playing, there is every chance they can achieve that double. They are on a winning spree and will go into the match on the back of four consecutive wins. In the last match, they beat the formidable DC and it's the all-round contribution that was again the key."", 'Quinton de Kock has found form, Suryakumar Yadav has looked impressive with two fifties in a row.

They need their bowlers to step up after the thumping loss against RCB.', 'On a slowish Sharjah surface, they conceded an above-par 194 against RCB in their last match and then crumbled to 112/9 in the chase. Their batsmen need to fire after the abject performance.

Nitish Rana, Eoin Morgan, Andre Russell all need to raise their game. Maybe KKR should look to push Russell up the order in order to get the best out of him.

His feet are placed around the leg stump. From there, he’s sort of realised that he’s got to get set first, he’s got to face a few balls, but as the innings go on and we get into the last five overs, he actually picks up a position covering all his stumps.

""A lot of it is around his mindset. What MS Dhoni thinks when he faces Rashid is that he only wants to rotate the strike. He doesn’t pick the bat up whatsoever, which gives him that attacking option to hit through the line.', '""His hands go nowhere and when he takes the stride, he just tries to use his wrists to push the ball into gaps. It’s almost a defensive mindset. He can go defensively and push the ball for one or he can use that cocked and ready loaded power that he possesses and really flow through the ball. I don’t think, he doesn’t tend to get those hands back in an attacking position.', '""You watch Kohli and he is ready to go, so if he wants to whack it, he can. Dhoni’s one or the other and that’s part of the problem – it’s all defence or all attack – and I would like to see a mix between the two.""', ""Further, Styris sought to dissect Dhoni's gameplan against pace bowlers as well. Dhoni, Styris concluded, scores most of his runs against pacers on leg side or straight down the ground."", '“Since 2018, MS Dhoni, against pace, scores all his boundaries pretty much down the ground or on the leg side. When we look at the percentages, it is almost exclusively 74 percent on the leg side, mainly in front of square, over 50 percent down the long-on and the leg side, which I think tells us where he is strong.""', 'Styris also concluded that teams need to test the former India skipper with the short ball a lot more as the right-hander is far too comfortable on the front foot.', 'Find latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.
